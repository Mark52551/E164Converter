E164Format Program | Mark Ruiz | November 13, 2017

Summary:
This program was created to take in a users input type string. 
Once the user inputs their phone number, the program will then
convert the phone number to E164 Format. 

Resources: 
I did not use any third party references (i.e. online resources)
I simply referred to prior programs that I have done in the past. 
All work was done by and created by Mark A. Ruiz

Solution:
For this small program, I wanted to focus on the overall
OO-Programming. For example, .h files, inheratence...etc.

Below are my functions that I used with a description of how I constructed them.
void phoneNumber::welcome()
>This was just so that the user will be able to know what they are doing upon
entering the program.
>Simple welcome message.

void phoneNumber::takeInputConvert()
>This function was the heart of the program. This is where the string being entered
by the user will be converted to E164 format.
>I used a do-while loop just so that I can have constant feedback (user input needed)
throughout the program, just in case they need to input more than just one number. 
>I used a try, throw, and catch just to make the facilitation of the error handling easier
>I used the for loops just to keep the facilitation of the phone number easier to handle

int main()
>Overall, I really like to take pride in my main functions. As an OO-Programmer, I like
to make the main function very simple and easy for anyone to look over. With that being
said, it puts high importance on the overall construction of the program. Therefore, allowing
the programmer to make clean and readible code. 

Commenting:
> I am a firm believer that if a programmer takes the time to assign good naming conventions
to variables, methods, etc. it reduces the need for commenting.
> Personally, I like to program and have great naming conventions so that if another
programmer decides to work on, or edit my code, they will be able to userstand what is going 
on without the need of alot of commenting.
